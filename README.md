## Problem Statement
Design Automated Traffic Control with RGB LEDs and only Digital Logic Circuits. First think where appropriate traffic lights would need to be placed. Make a sketch of the roads and plan accordingly. Give necessary delays in each light. Only the major roads need to be accounted for, ignore restricted access roads (for example, BUET Sonali Bank Road).

> DO NOT use any Microcontrollers for this project. For Timing signal generation, you can use 555 timer IC. Make a model of the roads using foamboard / cork-sheet / hard paper, and make small models of the traffic lights.

## Features
1. Traffic light of each junction with red, yellow and green should be implemented
2. Pedestrian crossing for each road needs to be defined
3. Pedestrians should be guided with red (wait) or cross (white) light
4. Yellow light should be implemented
5. At least for 1 junction, show the remaining time of red signal using a 7-segment display
6. Signals should be able to be manually switched with a push button
